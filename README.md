# Wine Quality Prediction

## Introduction

Welcome to the Wine Quality Prediction project, where we leverage machine learning and deep learning techniques to assess and determine the quality of wines based on various features. This project aims to provide valuable insights for wine enthusiasts, producers, and consumers alike.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about various attributes of wines, such as acidity levels, residual sugar, and alcohol content. The target variable is the quality of the wine, rated on a scale from 1 to 10.

## Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques

### 1. Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is employed to model the relationship between the input features and the binary outcome of wine quality. It's a fundamental algorithm for classification tasks.

### 2. Random Forest

Random Forest, an ensemble learning method, is utilized to build a robust model by combining multiple decision trees. It excels in capturing complex relationships within the dataset.

### 3. Neural Networks

Deep learning techniques, specifically neural networks, are applied to capture intricate patterns and dependencies in the data. The model is designed to automatically learn and adapt to the underlying structures.

### 4. Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Support Vector Machines are employed for classification tasks, aiming to find the hyperplane that best separates wines of different qualities. SVMs are powerful in handling both linear and non-linear relationships.
